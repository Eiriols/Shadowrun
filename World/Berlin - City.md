### History
```timeline
[line-3, body-3]
+ 1990
+ Formation of the Federal Republic of Germany
+ As in real life, the joining of east and west germany and the fall of the berlin wall marked the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany([[Allied German States|FRG]]). This is before the start of the 6th Age.

+ 2011
+ The 6th Age Begins
+ Marked as the Awakening of the world based on the Mayan Lunar Calender, however the awakening occured in the years before and after this date. 

+ 2023
+ Capital moves to Hannover afer Rioting
+ Riots in response to the goverment rounding up orks and trolls force the German government to move the Capital to [[Hannover]] and become the Allied German Countries ([[Allied German States|AGC]]).

+ 2039
+ The Night of Rage leads to Anarchists Taking Berlin
+ The Humanis group incites violence across the world. In Berlin Metahuman Racists cause riots in an attempt to kill metahumans. The people of Berlin fight back in a small-scale civil war despite the lack of support from the German government as part of the Anarchist Movement Berlin ([[Anarchist Movement Berlin|ABB]]). <br/> Many people are killed as a result of this action but the ABB kill the vast majority of the Humanis group and drive out the rest, they also are able to drive out the racist governemnt and declare Berlin an independant anarchist state and become the Neo-Anarchist Policlub ([[Anarchist Movement Berlin|NAP]]).

+ 2055
+ The Corps take back Berlin
+ Joint corporate forces, acting on orders of the German government, invaded the city and, after weeks of fighting, Anarchists and corporations agreed to sign a truce. Berlin was given a federal government-like city council and all of the districts were given semi-autonomus powers. Each of the districts selects a representative for the council. This allowed for the Corps to mov einto large parts of the city but a large anarcist movement remained.

+ 2061
+ The Present
+ Berlin has a lot of anti-governemnt and anti-corp representation but the Corps have a lot of power and very little drive to help the people. Some think it's going the way of other cities, others are still fighting to drive out the corps and making sure that they keep their power.
