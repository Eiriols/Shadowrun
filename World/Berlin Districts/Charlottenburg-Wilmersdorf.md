"ChaWi" is especially famous for its entertainment miles, cultural cultural establishments and shopping opportunities. However, it has never lost its contrasts that make up Berlin; whether they're high society, partygoers, sex workers, beggars, old growers and immigrants - they're all here.

 Berlin's middle class sits in extensively restored old building apartments, while the new global money nobility has created its own empire in strictly secured villa settlements in its superficial estates. From that, the district is a collection of more or less small residential areas, former village centres from the times before the status of F and various construction sites. Away from the residential areas, house fronts, squares, fountains and Gigantic statues in an Art Nouveau style dominate. This means that ChaWi is in stark contrast to the poorer districts, some who do not have enough money for roads.

The east of the district, beyond popular shops and shopping streets, serves as a home for workers and small employees. Individual shops are responsible for local supplies, while neighbourhood campaigns take care of the squares and each other. In between, there are always smaller centres, where tiny cafés and picturesque pubs mix with the workshops of the free craftsmen and artists and breathe an alternative flair to the surrounding area.
#### Villa districts
The villa colonies are called Neu-Westend and Grunewald. The latter also includes the rewilded recreation area (including the Dragon and Devil's Mountains), and both colonies are prime examples of the walled-in districts. Even if it is impossible to come in unseen, it does not change the fact that you can still get in, as they still needed for piano teachers, laundry service, household help, etc.
#### City West
In "City West" there is above all a landmark of Berlin: the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. The local Kurfürstendamm was built over with a glass roof and relief road, which is why the KuDamm Mall forms Europe's longest mall. Together with the New European Centre, which was inaugurated in 2070 and the noble department store KaDeWe, this complex forms one of the largest, completely climate-protected shopping and experience worlds outside of Asia.
