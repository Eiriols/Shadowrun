The Mitte district is usually equated with the historic Mitte district and thus the City Ost or Arealen of the City West, such as the Tiergarten or Zoo station, in the information and tourism portals. This includes the city planning desire to overcome the ancient separation of Berlin into several city centers as a relic of the past. With the focus on the city, however, other districts are also excluded from Mitte, which are not part of the city, such as Hansaviertel, Moabit, Wedding and Gesundbrunnen

For most tourists, Mitte is the actual destination, because the city's important sights and landmarks, the most famous clubs and the greatest density of bars, stages and restaurants are located here. In addition, the biggest banks, companies and hotels all have buildings here.

However, if you only a few meters away from the core area of the cities, then you will find predominantly quiet and controlled housing, the density of pubs decreases and the people who you encounter are actually locals. The more you move away, the more decayed the houses and the people slide significantly in the income class. At the furthest, when you reach the A100, you notice that the district has no interest in any beautiful facade for the tourists.

#### City Ost
The City Ost is the actual geographical and historical city centre of the Freistadt, but it is confusing among the Berliners as tourist districts that shed veneration like the devil's holy water. Here you can see the efforts of the city to appear stronger than anywhere else, clean, neat and peaceful to the outside. They tolerate a few pro-anarchist patches and unorthodox dress styles, but dangers of security are not to be ignored. 4]
