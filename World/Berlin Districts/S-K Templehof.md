Saeder-Krupp makes sure it's district has everything in order to satiate it's citizens and prevent them from leaving. Although Tempelhof is one of the smallest districts (especially if you don't consider the airport) you will find schools for every age and aptitude level, with the weaker pupils being supported specifically through tutoring and talent coaching. The Michel Loloit Primary School, which was named after the former BMW boss, is renowned. In addition, there are also restaurants for every taste, supermarkets with a large - and affordable - range offerings and what is not available on site, is also delivered by drone if the customer so wishes.

The fact that Saeder-Krupp relies on ultra-modern construction projects, which basically decide the typical architecture, or break down directly, puts the company on a confrontation course with the Prussian Foundation, which has also devoted itself in the Freistadt to preserve classic Berlin-typical or listed buildings.

#### Airport
In the Tempelhof-Mitte section, the Saeder-Krupp Tempelhof (SKT) airport is a scheduled stop from the time of the Second World War, which at that time had probably the largest building in the world. Dominated by marble inside and shell limestone on the exterior facade, red, beige and white are the colours that match the huge 20-metre-high hall. The airport itself, however, is a pure business airport, so you will not see an easy flat-rate tour operator here. In addition to small and private machinery, the airport can also handle the many cargo aircraft that start and land here every day. There is a huge goods handling warehouse nearby.

#### Aviation district
To the west of the airport is the aviation area, a settlement with a focus on families and a population of about 5,000 residents on an area of 1.5 km2. Inside the Wolfring, the high-ranking execs live in chic houses and enjoy the amenities that S-K offers them. In the vicinity of it there are employees in the middle management. The noise of the airport may disturb, but you don't have to live in an arcology. Nevertheless, every outgoing unit has prepared alternative accommodation, so that Tempelhof would be functional even in the event of complete isolation.

#### More quarters
South of the airport is Alt-Tempelhof, east of it is Neukölln (the parts that do not belong to Xhain and consist of old buildings). These historically grown parts are mainly inhabited by the workers and technicians S-Ks and is even open to non-corporate citizens if they are willing to submit to the laws of the mega and reveal practically everything. In return, you can live here quietly and safely.

#### Rix village
While the district of Rixdorf was the figurehead of frivolous entertainment in the former capital a good 150 years ago, the name is now used as a brand for strip clubs and pubs between Schillerkiez and the eastern district border. The city fathers had tried to get rid of the image by renaming it in "Neukölln", but today you know in Tempelhof that if you want to get on it, it is best to go to Rixdorf, . If you are looking for more, you have to go to Karl-Marx-Straße after Xhain.
