Lichtenberg has the mixture of depraved old buildings and apartment blocks with parking garages, whose lower underground parking garages are partly filled with vehicle wrecks, garbage.

Due to the size of the prefabricated buildings and terraced house settlements, the residents were forced to build up cross-municipal structures, since individual rattling wind turbines and a single rain barrel at the front and back were not enough to supply so many people. The fact that the buildings did not originally allow subsequent installations of furnace heaters and other amenities led to the assumption of an anarcho-syndicalist way of life. Major alliances were formed instead of block-wise mergers, thus making the best of circumstances. The principles of cooperative self-organisation and improvisation, which were already known in the GDR era, established largely functioning supply networks. Even the old systems have been converted into cooperative ones and have been operating very successfully for several years now. The local buildings include the 120-year-old prefabricated buildings of Neu-Hohenschönhausen, the ruins of former industrial centres in Rummelsburg and Herzberge, as well as the Wartenberg district.
