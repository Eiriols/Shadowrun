One can divide Oranienburg into three areas: The west of the district is located between Germendorf, Leegebruch and the Oranienburg Canal, is rural and is owned by the Federal Border Protection

The south includes Birkenwerder, Borgsdorf and Velten, thus bordering Reinickendorf. Accordingly, it is in no way inferior to the remnants of Berlin, especially since the local population live in corrugated iron huts and caravan settlements and consists mainly of what has been driven out of the better areas. The old Clara Zetkin memorial and its surroundings have developed into an anarchist stronghold.

The northeast consists of the actual Oranienburg and is firmly in the hands of the investor group Oranienburg (IGO). This has allowed the city centre to be maintained and built new villa districts, where Berlin's rich can find refuge and tranquillity. The only stain in the area is the former Sachsenhausen concentration camp, which ruins the real estate values in the area. As a countermeasure, the IGO has built a number of automatic factories as a buffer to the astraly dangerous area and covers up any incidents.
