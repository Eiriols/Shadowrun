Kreuzhain is primarily known as a "colorful, cosmopolitan, multicultural, artistic, freedom party district" that attracts tourists, students, young people and corporations who want to escape everyday life with full surveillance for at least a few hours and without putting their lives in danger in the dangerous zones of Berlin. However, even in Kreuzhain this is never entirely without risk, as even under the most optimal conditions, the meeting of drunken revelers with the residents of the emirate part of the district is risky. Therefore, the fun and stoning zones have been clearly separated from each other by green gates and large warning notices in all languages.

In 2080, the Shariarists increasingly left their area in order to then loudly express their displeasure "outside" in Kreuzhain and Mitte. Fortunately, there have been no shots fired at the "Kafirs" (infidels) so far, which is not least due to the cooperation of the Xhainer neighborhoods. The local neighbors accompany the stray groups of young Islamists, speak to them in a friendly manner, invite them to a discussion about the grievances and then quickly lead them back to the Sharia areas. The routine in dealing with such crisis situations shows the open mentality of the older Kreuzhainers, who, despite gentrification and displacement from some of the posh luxury neighborhoods, still represent the majority in the district today. Conflicts were part of status F and Kreuzhain has enough experience with them that even almost 30 years later it has not forgotten the art of negotiation. You can feel this again and again on Labor Day, when there is a state of emergency throughout Berlin.
