Since the 2060s, the cityscape of Strausberg has been determined by a cycle of construction and decay. This is due to the many factory fortresses, the size of which does not matter and is therefore surrounded by several exclusion zones. This can be a fence with barbed wire and warning signs on the very outside, while behind it there are piles of rubble or building ruins as visual barriers, then an area cleared of vegetation and peppered with sensors and defense drones, which can be overlooked from a distance with watchtowers and the main walls of the actual complex.

Between the factory fortresses there are numerous supplier companies that have either grown naturally or have since disappeared again. Anything that cannot be recycled in some way is simply left behind. Therefore, there are dilapidated commercial buildings, dumps and scrap metal here, as well as some poor housing estates, contaminated wastelands with toxic puddles and smaller islands with shopping and entertainment establishments for the failed people who have somehow arrived in Strausberg.

For shadowrunners, Strausberg is a land of milk and honey, as the district is an F region with countless hiding places and corporate islands of the A to AA standard, which also offers plenty of opportunities for retreat and escape. Just expect to run into poison spirits, gangers, ghouls, and paracritters and plants. In some respects, the district is reminiscent of the SOX.

#### Environmental pollution
Strausberg is increasingly struggling with the fact that it has to serve more and more for illegal waste disposal. This stems from the fact that alternative waste services have been dumping their waste for years on the of Shiawase in JWD, but which Brandenburgare located in the Brandenburg Alliance. The Federal Border Guard has switched over to return waste transport to Berlin without valid freight documents and CEERS ID or ADL visa. In the meantime, the situation in Strausberg is becoming critical, because not only a groundwater contamination is threatened, but also a rat plague. The mega-volume dumping 16-6, which has long since buried the Brandenburg ghost village of Rehfelde, deteriorates the already disastrous, ecological situation in the district.

The local Bötzsee is heavily contaminated and around it is the equally distorted mixed forest, which is called the Grendelwald. Densely and darkly, it seems to blossom almost through soil contamination and acid rain and continuously expand. In the meantime, he has reached point mill and post-break, two ghost towns, and devoured them with their factory ruins. In the west, it now reaches Altlandsberg to a few hundred metres. The streams and ponds are full of oil films, the forest smells of hidden dumps and even if the forest is still and looks healthy, you should only enter it in chemical sealing. It is amazing that there seem to be no Toxic ghosts here. However, there is some exploration team in the ruins of Bruchmühle whose vehicles, protective suits and base have no markings.
