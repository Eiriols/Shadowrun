Köpenick is a surprisingly open and green district. Between hemp plantations are surprisingly clean watercourses and everyday life also benefits from clean air, natural food and a largely peaceful atmosphere. The district can boast a center of freethinkers, romantics and philosophers. At the centre of the whole are a love of freedom and naturalness, which runs like a red thread through the population. 

The inhabitants are working on informal self-sufficiency. Electricity comes from wind, water and sun, while arable land and orchards produce natural food. Some care about sustainability and quality, others want their personal utopia and the majority simply refuses to make even more money for the mega-companies. The openness of the district residents means people usually get along well with each other as long as their basis of this coexistence is same.

In Köpenick, too, you can feel the stark contrasts that make up Berlin. On the one hand there are construction cars and houseboats, philosophical meeting places and private cafés with home-brewed herbal tea and on the other hand the top-modern villas of managers and intellectuals, who despite their day jobs do not want to miss the harmonious society around them. The alternative artistic scene is included in the renaturalised Müggelsee and the picturesque canals of Wilhelmsagen, which finds not only inspiration, but also patrons. The group formation of the Nouveau Boheme creates seemingly homogeneous factions, however this creates more discussion of the differences, instead of making this end in tangible debates
### Old Köpenick

The Alte Köpenick stands out with its old town. Here are small cafés, philosophical salons and art projects that give the district an alternative, friendly and above all hopeful image, which is in harmony with nature

### Müggelberge

While the mouth-to-mouth residents of the district interact openly with each other, the magical usually remain among themselves. They are therefore found above all in the Müggelbergswhere they have created their communes.
