 Despite its loss of territory, Reinickendorf is still the largest district in Berlin and, with the exception of a few, narrowly defined high-rise housing estates such as the Märkisches Viertel or the new ABZ residential park, Nordbahn is flat. In Gen Rand, the picture changes to disintegrated terraced and single-family housing estates, such as Frohnau, Schönfließ or Mühlenbeck. Since many Reinickendorfers fled disproportionately from Berlin, the district was subject to severe use of plundering gangs during the early years of anarchy. The more domestic working-class settlements from the Weimar Republic and post-war construction, on the other hand, became breeding grounds of and despair. The "fox construction", originally known as the residential area of Borsigwalde-Wittenau, has taken its name from the fact that it has been a well-fortified and protected retreat of the anarchist resistance for decades.

The Märkische Viertel suffered from 2081 under large-scale power outages plagued by parts of Reinickendorf. - According to the Ruhr-Nuklear energy supplier, these were attributable to illegal and improperly cable work by alternative companies, and were unrelated to the blackouts in the UCAS in the previous year.

In Reinickendorf is also the so-called "relaxation town" Monamour , a home bond in ESUS enclosed and gated community for heeled tenants. The streets within this area even have French street names such as Rue Charles de Gaulle.
