In Schönefeld, the automotive industry is mainly located next to the airport. Whether engines, parts or entire vehicles - the factories are never standing still. Dominated by Messerschmitt-Kawasaki and other players in the industry, countless cars, motorcycles and drones run by the ribbons around the clock, they are polished, refined, tuned, and finally kept ready in the endless parking lots or glass towers for the clientele from the free city, the ADL or the rest of the world. If it drives, flies or somewhat moves elsewhere, it and its individual parts are produced here.

It can contend with the industrial density of the AGC Siemensstadt, but has proper area planning and has at least a reasonably ADL-compliant consideration of existing labor, safety and environmental standards. The reason for this is probably that it has always been "far away" from the anarchy of the city center. The massive presence of M-K and its proximity to the airport gave manufacturers and suppliers a reliable framework for planning. The fact that M-K could rely on Saeder-Krupp in safety also helped to minimize defense measures, since not every single shed had to be secured with an overkill of protective measures.

With the Berlin unification, Schönefeld was once again able to accelerate its development, which means that the district is one of the winners of unity. Everywhere old buildings are demolished and completely new ones are raised. The factory streets are repaired, important connections are fully refurbished and, thanks to GridLink, also optimised for transport drones. However, due to the construction measures, traffic jams are constant and when a construction site is completed, the next one is started right next door. Towards the airport and the M-K factory, you can see what this hustle and bustle comes down to: a driverless ballet of closely sweltering shops and drone vehicles that is reminiscent of the Port of Hamburg.

The residential areas such as Lichtenrade or small-town detached house areas such as Mahlow may also be old, but, unlike in other peripheral areas, are inhabited by the workers and employees on the ground. Initially, Großziethen or Kiekebusch had large open spaces, on which some architecturally questionable new housing estates, or even a lot of new factories and logistics centres were built near the airport. Between the old buildings are painters, drone repairers, classic car spare parts warehouses and things for everyday needs, such as shopping centers and food businesses.

#### BSI Airport
The local Berlin-Schönefeld International Airport (BSI) is the all-dominating factor in the district, to which directly the Arkology of Messerschmitt-Kawasaki is connected, which is generally referred to as "The Factory ". Everything else in the district has to submit to these two and unsurprisingly the unbridled growth is most clearly visible here. However, this also means that more and more residents and suppliers feel crowded together or are being completely displaced. This leads to the fact that newer residential houses and production facilities are increasingly growing, roads and supply routes are becoming wider or placed another level. Things that are in the way must be torn down.
