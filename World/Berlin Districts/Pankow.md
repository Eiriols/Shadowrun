From a architectural point of view, Pankow is most likely to be compared to Marzahn, even though the many prefabricated buildings were replaced by endless single-family housing estates. There is enormous vacancy, as the families who once lived here fled due to the Russian threat during the Eurowars and later then with chaos and anarchy of Fluxus status. What was not burned down by the looting gangs to its foundations has today fallen into disrepair, partially collapsed or become completely uninhabitable. Therefore, Berlin's residential tower districts were built in other places. Bernau forms the old industrial core of the district around which a small belt has emerged from cheap and temporary factory buildings.

Not least because of the political conditions (and therefore - often inadequate and inefficient infrastructure), the corporations seem to be uncertain about what they want to do in and with the district. For example, there are many group-owned properties, but of these, many of them empty or lie fallow for the time being.

A clear contrast to the grey buildings is the cemetery Berlin-Wei√üensee, a beautiful green area that is well suited for anyone who wants something natural in the city, especially since there are hardly any ghouls there. To achieve the this reduction in hauntings, the area is frequented by some Jewish magicians.

#### Dreamland
On the southern edge of Pankow in Renrakusan is an extensive slum area, which is generally referred to as "Dreamland". This boulevard of broken dreams does not have its name by chance, because here you can feel "like you're on cloud 7", with sex, cram and BTLs. In addition, there is also a never completed arcology of the Draco Foundation, which is simply referred to by the residents as "The Heaven ".
