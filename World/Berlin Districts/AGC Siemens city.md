#### Description
It is an extraterritorial district owned my AG Chemie.

The AGC Siemensstadt is a huge conglomeration of pipes and conveyor belts, full of heavy duty drones and hosts of the cheapest metahuman workers. Everyone who lives here is of the lowest wealth bracket and has no way of advancing, the housing is the worst in the city and makes the smallest apartment feel like a mansion.
##### Siemensst√§tten
Formerly referred to as _Charlottenburg-Nord_, the Siemens sites east of the Yezuba Circle are currently still in a slightly better state than the rest of the district. In addition to the light and pharmaceutical industry, there are multi-family and individual houses, some of which are more than 150 years old and are even occasionally renovated by the AGC. Residents and workers are lower and medium-level employees, who have acceptable conditions.
