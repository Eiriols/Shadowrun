Gropiusstadt is a huge gang playground, controlled by the Horde. The corporations fled a long time ago before the bubbling violence, they shut the district off to leave the inhabitants to their own devices. The old high-rises, some of which are more than 100 years old, crowd closely together and show numerous scars of past violence, while waste and junk pile up to make mountains. Those blocks that had better buildings were expanded into gang fortresses, leading to the neighbouring blocks via risky and shaky bridges.

Saeder-Krupp has secured the border of the corporate district Tempelhof to this urban hell with a high, heavily guarded wall. At the border to the Schönefeld district with the airport of the same name, there is no wall, but a barrier belt with fences and (former?) Death strip. The signs that once warned of mines and self-shot plants no longer exist, and the sentrys were mined, but hardly anyone risks entering or leaving the district in this way, and possibly triggering a forgotten anti-personnel mine.
##### St. Melitta-Kiet

A haven of peace within the chaos of Gropiusstadt is the church , whose pastor Siegfried Sorgenheimer has managed to effectively pacify the surrounding St. Melita-Kiez as an intermediary. In particular, the Catholic parish priest helps the young people the - in itself multi-confessional - where he can. He is particularly desperate for the opposite Block X.[[ 1]
##### Block X

The Block X is a red light area opposite St. Melitta Church. The area is located in a disintegrated mega-block and houses countless bars, tattoo studios, drug holes, corridors and descending. [5] In addition, Block X is the headquarters of the new rulers of the Horde and who are downright notorious for their violence and excessive PArtys.
