Renraku has completely redesigned its district, and transformed it into a second chic size, so that the old Prenzlberg can see practically nothing: black marble and mirror glass, which runs along the straight houses, as well as an endless flash storm from Holos, countless screens and AR figures that dance across the crowds. The fact that Renrakusan is also one of the most densely populated districts creates a single cacophony of postmodernism. Renrakusan serves as a prototype of a smart city, where everything is connected with everything. Vehicles, drones and goods flows are perfectly clocked together, so that shelves and refrigerators fill up virtually independently, roads are only illuminated if they are also used and the AR plus intelligent floor coverings manage to guide people subtly into offers that are relevant to them.

The district is overshadowed by the pyramid of Miyako-Arkologie, while the streets of noisy pachinko halls, small shops and karaoke bars and simple Shops offer everything they can expect from a corporate city in style. Also behind the high walls, Japan is omnipresent, where Japanese gardens, teahouses and bathhouses, Shinto temples and shrines as well as Bunraku borels are hidden. On the border of Renrakusan, the three 416-meter-high towers of the 2075 Japan Business Center (JBC), which belong to the three Japanese triple-a corporations Mitsuhama, Shiawase and the lead Renraku, rise to the touch and demonstrate the power and unity of the Japan's power in Berlin.

Even if many tourists come to the district, the streets are more likely to see the working uniforms of the Renraku members. On the often drivable walkways, strictly cut hideo-tato suits and red overalls are the norm, and more rarely you can see western Renraku labels such as Europe and Stadl. 7] In the shop windows and advertisements you can see circular manga figures, the Sloppy Soy drinks, vending machine food and various host, maiden, pachinko or taito clubs, while the streets are increasingly ridden by Isuzu -E scooters, Honor saloon, Kamekichi trucks and also the -E small car series. Meanwhile, the corporate children who make excursions to the anarcho districts are on their way to Gaz-Niki terrain machines, with martially decorated full helmets to disguise their identity. The humanoid drones, which are a status symbol of the renracolate, are also dominant. Everywhere you can see types of the Manservant, Barback, Nadeshiko and others walking through the streets with bags and bags - either in a bare-futuristic purist look, others lavishly styled as oversexualized women.

#### Kanazuri-Dori
Most of the side streets of Renracusean are nameless, as is customary in Japan, and the buildings are numbered in a way that is not obvious to outsiders. Only the large thoroughfares have names, including the Kanazuri-Dori, which is called the "Broadway" of Renrakusan. Previously, the extension of the street "Unter den Linden" meant "Prenzlauer Allee" and can boast today of being the most magnificent business street in the district, which is also seen because some of the most important locations are here. In addition to the glakk-O absurdity department store with the Furry-and-Freak-Disco Kawaii, the Tanzclub 2 loop, which is popular with middle management, there is Samuraiii!!, an overrun wage slave visit, the database giant comQube and Renrakus huge Berlin "Volkshochschule" Keisei Chansu and finally the noble restaurant Himeji-Towers

However, you have to be careful: The Kanazuri is by far the worst spam zone in all of Berlin and absolutely demands the use of the AR from non-Japanese, as otherwise you will get into trouble understanding the street completely in Japanese. One way to reduce spam is to hide the AR figures. These usually differ if you do not use any special software, such as using .rez from the Hackbirds.
