Potsdam with its countless gardens, castles and palaces is a district of extremes. On the one hand, there are picturesque areas with a lot of history, while on the other side certain regions have become completely derelict.

#### Centre 
The inner centre around the old town, as well as the castle and park Sanssouci is increasingly becoming a historicizing show stage of former Prussia. For this purpose, construction work was scheduled for some time ago, which was supposed to be finished recently, but is still in full swing. They don't shy away from razing even popular locations to the ground if it does not fit into the desired era, others are completely rebuilt. Historically suitable buildings, on the other hand, are being renovated. Historical reality is not in planning, but rather the image that one wants to show from the conceived and propagated "Prussia"; a tidy and clean image.

The centre is supposed to be the figurehead of the entire district and displaces everything else. Castles, gates and squares are restored to show visitors glamour and glory of the old Prussia. But this is actually a pearl of the swine, because the average citizen has a rough idea at best of what Prussia was (or is?) and what it looked like.

The renovation planning comes from the pen of the Prussian Foundation and its experts, but the implementation is considerably more difficult to put into practice. Demonstrations, static problems and, most recently, the unresolved death of the leading specialist in architecture of the early modern period, delayed the completion of the construction efforts which have continued to fall into the future. Away from the buildings, considering the small details such as street lamps, benches or paving away to create a suitable atmosphere. With locations such as the Hindersin, which was set up in a former corner pub, it looks different. One serves "Prussian specialties", but it is unlikely that the Prussians consumed so much cheap soya.

#### East
The east of Potsdam from Babelsberg to Drewitz, which is the stark opposite. The pomp and hazy of the castles gives way to the dreary apartment blocks of the poorest of the poor, which often offer nothing more than a cage-sized apartment with leaking windows, needle covered staircases and garbage-covered front gardens. You only notice how bad it is when you don't even find anarchist undercurrents. Anyone who lives here has just enough energy for their own survival, which is doubly depressing, considering that Potsdam could easily spare money to put an end to these conditions.

#### West and North
The mediocrity, on the other hand, resides in Potsdam-West with Golm and Potsdam-Nord with Bornstedt to Nedlitz. The apartment blocks are inexpensively patched and at least are passable to the outside, but behind them are many defects, but at least you can live here. The lower middle class, who has moved the local blocs, does not have to fight against a possible descent and here it seems like a fate that only others can rush.
