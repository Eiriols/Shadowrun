Zehlendorf is one of the better districts of Berlin and is not only one of the largest, but also the richest and even greenest districts in the west of the Free City. Apart from the inner-city center of Steglitz, the Lichterfelde industrial sector, the mega residential blocks of Marienstadt on the border with Gropiusstadt and the Hortbau satellite town of Teltow-Ost near Heinersdorf, the district is spacious and predominantly flat. Therefore, places like Grunewald/Dahlem, Nikolassee and Wannsee consist primarily of wealthy villa enclaves to which outsiders are not allowed access.

The district's most important shopping mile is Schlossallee with the Steglitz town hall and the nearby Sternschutz operations center in the "Bierpinsel" directly on the district border. Important leisure facilities are located on the Großer Wannsee between the famous Wannsee lido, which is spanned by an increasingly mossy roof shell, and the Wannsee harbor.

Apart from the problem district of Marienstadt, which stretches from Mariendorf-West to Marienfelde-Nord, Zehlendorf is considered a tolerant and safe district that Berliners like to visit for shopping and relaxing. A popular hobby is exotic ogling, as the long-standing presence of the Evo and Proteus companies has led to an increased proportion of transgenic or optically modified people.

#### Zehlendorfer plate
The now defunct Fuchi Industrial Electronics apparently had big plans for Zehlendorf. The company had to build a gigantic facility with several arcologies and mega-factories, which also explains the 400 x 400 meter arcology foundation of the Zehlendorfer Platte. After the company's demise, Proteus took over its possessions and placed four towers on it, which, together with the unfinished "Kowloon", are now only echoes of these dreams.

#### Under Zehlendorf
Apparently Fuchi had done much more than just pour a foundation. Numerous old Fuchi tunnels run underground. During construction work, shafts, transport tubes and blind monorail tunnels often come to light. Most of them are immediately backfilled, but in the depths beneath the "Kowloon" there are said to be further access routes that supposedly allow access to the facilities of other districts.

Apparently all sorts of things can be found in the shafts under Zehlendorf; Rumors speak of nests of forgotten critters from the big zoo liberation campaign, cockroach ghosts, secret neighborhood communities and also people who lay cables in the dark in order to expand the cable matrix.
