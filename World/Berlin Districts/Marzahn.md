Marzahn, like many other districts, has a whole range of different construction and settlement structures. The actual "Höllendorf" mainly includes the densely built-up prefabricated and single-house settlements in the municipalities, Hellersdorf/Kaulsdorf and Biesdorf. In addition, there are also parts such as Neuenhagen, Schöneiche or the picturesque shores of Woltersdorf and Erkner, which are so far from the crisis zones of Marzahn that one might believe they belong to another district.

What unites all parts of Marzahn, however, is decline. Even the areas that were not destroyed by looters, rioters or gangs fell instead at home in the ravages of time and slowly but surely became uninhabitable. Collapsed roofs, closed entrances, trees that grow on the streets, rubble dumps towering in the forests and burnt-out cars, line the sidewalks and are a daily sight.

The cityscape throughout the district is dominated in large parts of depraved prefabricated buildings and apartment blocks. Newer residential complexes such as the BV-1837, built by the S-K subsidiary hangout, as part of the "Forststadt Hoppegarten", for which one has clearly cut down the forest along Birkenheimer Straße, are clearly among the better addresses, since they offer reliable electricity and water supply, regular garbage collection, building cleaning and maintenance as well as matrix cover including AR and in-house guard protection .

#### Faschokieze
Marzahn-Hellersdorf has shown some well-known "Fascists", which - to the annoyance of the declared anti-fascists among the Berliner alternatives - are firmly in the right-wing radical hand, and occupy what must be considered as "national-liberated zones". These include, for example, the neighbourhoods of the newly built-up Falkenhöhe area and the degenerate industrial park of Wolfener Straße.
